# Find a campsite, be happy

  For the next 30 weekends from today, check if any campsites are available.

# Why?

  * Don't have time to sit and click around to see only two weeks
    worth of availability for campsites at certain parks when searching
    for a good campsite. Especially when weekends are almost always
    fully booked up at certain parks.

  * No public access to a legit API.

  * Convenient, saves time. I can now find what campsites are available at
    a few parks within 60 seconds, as opposed to 60 minutes.

# Usage

  Download `camp_search.rb` and run `ruby camp_search.rb`.
